   Dennis Ritchie was an American computer scientist who created the C programming
  language which is one of the <br />most popular programming languages and the Unix operating system with his long-time colleague Ken Thompson.
  <br /> Ritchie was born in New York in 1947. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie who was a longtime Bell Labs scientist and co-author of
  <br />The Design of Switching Circuits. Ritchie graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics 
  and applied mathematics.<br /> After, he followed his father's lead to work at Bell Labs and worked there until his retirement in 2007.</div></p>

   <p><div style="text-align: center">Ritchie and Thompson developed the C in the Bell Labs between 1969 to 1973. Ritchie was the author of the C Programming Language
  in 1978 and <br />the Unix Programmer's Manual in 1971.Today, what we use about computer and software is because of Ritchie's works. He has
  been chosen the most<br /> influential software programmer of all time.<a href="http://www.ranker.com/list/most-influential-software-programmers-of-all-time/ready-to-startup" > * </a>
  The C is still the most widely-used language of all time. The modern programming languages like C++, Java, C# <br />was affected by the C.
 The Linux Operation System and its tools were based on Ritchie's works. Unix is the operating system of most large internet servers,<br /> universities,
 businesses and a major part of academic. It directly led to the open source community and the current computer culture.</div></p>

   In 1983, Ritchie received The Turing Award with Thompson for their development o f Generic Operation Systems Theory and specially for the
 Unix<br /> Operating System. In 1990, Ritchie and Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)<br /> for the origination
 of the Unix Operating System and the C. Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum in 1997.
 Both Ritchie<br /> and Thompson receives the National Medal of Technology.</div></p>
